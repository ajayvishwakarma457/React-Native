10 years of experience React Native developer should have the skills

1. Core React Native Expertise
  Deep knowledge of React Native internals (bridge, Fabric, TurboModules, Hermes engine).
  Strong command over JavaScript (ES6+) & TypeScript.
  Advanced React concepts: hooks, context, HOCs, state management.
  Performance optimization: lazy loading, memoization, avoiding re-renders.
  Deep knowledge of navigation (React Navigation, deep linking, stack/tab/drawer).
  Experience with animation libraries (Reanimated, Gesture Handler, Lottie).

2. Mobile-Specific Knowledge
  Native module development (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Java/Kotlin for Android).
  Integration with platform APIs (camera, sensors, push notifications, biometrics, background services).
  Offline-first strategies (SQLite, Realm, WatermelonDB, AsyncStorage).
  Handling app lifecycle events and background tasks.
  App performance profiling (Flipper, Android Profiler, Xcode Instruments).

3. Architecture & State Management
  Expertise in Redux Toolkit, MobX, Zustand, Recoil, RTK Query.
  Scalable architecture: MVVM, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, Modular Monorepo.
  Code-level patterns: Repository, Observer, Dependency Injection.
  Separation of concerns: UI layer vs business logic vs data layer.

4. Testing & Quality
  Unit testing (Jest, React Native Testing Library).
  E2E testing (Detox, Appium).
  Snapshot testing.
  CI/CD pipeline integration with testing stages.
  Code review best practices, static analysis (ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier).

5. DevOps & Deployment
  CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Bitrise, CircleCI, Fastlane.
  App signing, provisioning profiles, certificates.
  OTA updates with CodePush or Expo Updates.
  Experience with App Store / Play Store publishing and release pipelines.
  Monitoring tools: Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, Instabug.

6. Cloud & Backend Integration
  RESTful APIs, GraphQL (Apollo, URQL).
  Realtime updates (WebSockets, Firebase, MQTT).
  AWS Amplify, Firebase, or custom backend integration.
  Authentication/Authorization: JWT, OAuth2, biometric auth.
  Payment integration (Stripe, Razorpay, Apple Pay, Google Pay).

7. UI/UX Excellence
  Pixel-perfect implementation from Figma/Sketch/Zeplin.
  Responsive design for different screen sizes & orientations.
  Accessibility (a11y) standards, internationalization (i18n).
  Dark mode, theming, and design system implementation.

8. Leadership & Soft Skills
  Leading a team of 5–20 developers.
  Conducting code reviews & mentoring junior/mid-level devs.
  Estimating effort, sprint planning, Agile/Scrum practices.
  Cross-team collaboration with backend, QA, product managers, designers.
  Strong problem-solving & debugging mindset.

9. Emerging & Advanced Skills
  Experience with Expo SDK vs Bare Workflow trade-offs.
  Micro-frontends / Micro-apps in mobile.
  Cross-platform beyond React Native (Flutter, Kotlin Multiplatform) awareness.
  AR/VR (ARKit, ARCore), Wearables, TV apps if relevant.
  Security best practices (obfuscation, SSL pinning, secure storage).

✅ In short: 
A 10-year React Native developer should not only write code but also design architecture, lead teams, integrate DevOps, and ensure enterprise-level scalability & performance.
